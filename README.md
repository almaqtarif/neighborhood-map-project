This is my final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. Project goal is to build the project from scratch, without any existing starter code to rely on.Starting from nothing gives you a significant amount of freedom to make your own design decisions. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## TL;D

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## What You're Getting
```bash

├── SEARCH_TERMS.md # The whitelisted short collection of available search terms for you to use with your app.
├── package.json # npm package manager file. It's unlikely that you'll need to modify this.
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico # React Icon, You may change if you wish.
│   └── index.html # DO NOT MODIFY
└── src
    ├── App.css # Styles for your app. Feel free to customize this as you desire.
    ├── App.js # This is the root of your app. Contains static HTML right now.
    ├── App.test.js # Used for testing. Provided with Create React App. Testing is encouraged, but not required.
    ├── API # A JavaScript API called SquareAPI for Google maps.
    ├── icons # Helpful images for your app. Use at your discretion.
    │   ├── add.svg
    │   ├── arrow-back.svg
    │   └── arrow-drop-down.svg
    ├── index.css # Global styles. You probably won't need to change anything here.
    └── index.js # You should not need to modify this file. It is used for DOM rendering only.
```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.
You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`index.js`](src/API/index.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`baseURL`](#baseURL)
* [`auth`](#auth)
* [`headers`](#headers)
* [`urlBuilder`](#urlBuilder)
* [`simpleFetch`](#simpleFetch)
* [`search`](#search)
* [`getVenueDetails`](#getVenueDetails)
* [`getVenuePhotos`](#getVenuePhotos)
